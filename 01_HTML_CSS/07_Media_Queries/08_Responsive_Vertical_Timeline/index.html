              Tim laid out his vision for what would become the web in a
              document called “Information Management: A Proposal”. Believe it
              or not, Tim’s initial proposal was not immediately accepted. In
              fact, his boss at the time, Mike Sendall, noted the words “Vague
              but exciting” on the cover.

              Tim had written the three fundamental technologies that remain the
              foundation of today’s web (and which you may have seen appear on
              parts of your web browser): HTML: HyperText Markup Language. The
              markup (formatting) language for the web. URI: Uniform Resource
              Identifier. A kind of “address” that is unique and used to
              identify to each resource on the web. It is also commonly called a
              URL. HTTP: Hypertext Transfer Protocol. Allows for the retrieval
              of linked resources from across the web.

              Tim moved from CERN to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology
              to found the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), an international
              community devoted to developing open web standards. He remains the
              Director of W3C to this day.
