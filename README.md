Skills for properly structuring the Front-End part of web applications and ways to style it according to a given design will be acquired. In the second part of the module, they will receive basic knowledge of the JavaScript language, including syntax basics, working with arrays, matrices, objects, classes, and writing functions. Students will develop their algorithmic thinking. They will be able to work with the DOM tree, perform manipulations on it, and work with events. Functional and OOP approaches to programming with JavaScript will be covered. Concepts for data transmission via HTTP and REST will be studied.
